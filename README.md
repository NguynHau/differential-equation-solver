# Differential Equation Solver

A Python project for solving **ordinary differential equations (ODEs)** symbolically using **SymPy** and visualizing results with **Matplotlib**.

The project supports both **first-order ODEs** and **higher-order ODEs**, with visualization tools such as direction fields and solution curves.

# Features

## First-Order ODE Solver

- Symbolic solution using **SymPy**
- Solve equations with **initial conditions**
- Plot solution curves
- **Direction field visualization**
- Combined plot of **solution + direction field**

## Higher-Order ODE Solver

- Solve higher-order differential equations
- Support for **multiple initial conditions**
- Plot solution curves

# Supported Input Syntax

Example equation

```
y^3*(x-1) = y^2
```

Derivative notation used in the program

| Input | Meaning |
|------|------|
| `y'` | first derivative |
| `y^2` | second derivative (interpreted as `y''`) |
| `y^3` | third derivative (interpreted as `y'''`) |

The power operator `^` is automatically converted to Python `**`.

# Initial Conditions Format

Initial conditions are entered using the format

```
(order, x, value)
```

Examples

```
0,2,2   -> y(2) = 2
1,2,1   -> y'(2) = 1
2,2,1   -> y''(2) = 1
```

Enter

```
x
```

to stop entering conditions.

## Higher-Order ODE Solver

Example equation


```
(x-1)y'''=y''
```


Initial conditions

```
y(2) = 2
y'(2) = 1
y''(2) = 1
```

Solution plot
